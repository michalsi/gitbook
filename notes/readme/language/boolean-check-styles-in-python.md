# Boolean Check Styles in Python

{% hint style="info" %}
* Use `not` for checking false conditions, e.g., `assert not condition`.
* Avoid explicit comparisons to `False` with `is` or `==` for readability.

#### Detailed Note on Boolean Checks in Python <a href="#detailed-note-on-boolean-checks-in-python" id="detailed-note-on-boolean-checks-in-python"></a>

**Idiomatic Style**

* **Preferred:** Use `not` to check for falsy values.
  * Example: `assert not should_skip_element(item, args)`
* **Avoid:** Explicit comparisons to `False` using `is` or `==`.
  * Example: `assert should_skip_element(item, args) is False`

**Why Use `not`? ðŸ¤”**

* **Readability:** `not` is more concise and aligns with Python idioms.
* **Consistency:** Matches how conditions are written in `if` and `while` statements.
* **Pythonic:** Embraces Python's philosophy of simplicity and readability.

**Technical Details**

* `is` Operator: Checks object identity, not just equality. `True` and `False` are singletons but using `is` for booleans is not idiomatic.
* **Boolean Context:** Python evaluates conditions in a boolean context, making `not` a natural choice.

**Common Practices ðŸš€**

* Use `not` for falsy checks in assertions and conditionals.
* Follow linter guidelines (e.g., `pylint`, `flake8`) to maintain code quality and readability.

**Example**

```python
# Idiomatic
assert not should_skip_element(file_path, args)

# Non-idiomatic
assert should_skip_element(file_path, args) is False
```



**Benefits of Idiomatic Style**

* **Clarity:** Easier for other developers to read and understand.
* **Maintenance:** Simplifies code updates and reduces potential errors.
* **Style Consistency:** Keeps codebase uniform and aligned with community practices.
