# Managing Page Objects with Interfaces and Types

As my Playwright test suite grows, managing numerous page objects becomes a challenge. Utilising TypeScript interfaces and types offers a structured approach to organising these objects, enhancing code maintainability and readability.

### What are TypeScript Interfaces and Types?

TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript, introduces static types to help catch errors at compile time.

* **Interfaces**: Define the structure of an object, specifying the properties and methods it should have.
* **Types**: Similar to interfaces but offer more flexibility, such as defining union or intersection types.

### Why Use Interfaces or Types?

1. **Type Safety**: Ensures objects adhere to defined structures, reducing runtime errors.
2. **Code Completion**: Enhances IDE support, providing suggestions and documentation.
3. **Documentation**: Serves as clear documentation for the structure and purpose of objects.
4. **Maintainability**: Simplifies refactoring and maintaining the codebase.

### Implementing Interfaces or Types for Page Objects

#### Step 1: Define Interfaces or Types

Define an interface or type to describe all page objects in the suite.

```typescript
// pageObjects.ts
import { SummaryPage } from './pages/SummaryPage';
import { PortfolioPage } from './pages/PortfolioPage';

// Define an interface or type for page objects
interface PageObjects {
  summaryPage: SummaryPage;
  portfolioPage: PortfolioPage;
  // Add additional page objects as needed
}
```

#### Step 2: Use Interfaces or Types in Fixtures

Incorporate the `PageObjects` interface or type in the Playwright fixture to enforce a structured context object.

```typescript
// fixtures/pages.ts
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';
import { SummaryPage } from './pages/SummaryPage';
import { PortfolioPage } from './pages/PortfolioPage';
import { PageObjects } from './pageObjects'; // Import the interface/type

// Extend the base test with the PageObjects type
export const test = base.extend<{ context: PageObjects }>({
  context: async ({ page }, use) => {
    const context: PageObjects = {
      summaryPage: new SummaryPage(page),
      portfolioPage: new PortfolioPage(page),
      // Initialize additional page objects
    };
    await use(context);
  },
});
```

#### Step 3: Use the Context in Tests

Leverage the typed context object in test files for improved safety and IDE support.

```typescript
// tests/example.test.ts
import { test } from '../fixtures/pages';
import { expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('test summary page', async ({ context }) => {
  const { summaryPage } = context;
  await summaryPage.navigate();
  await summaryPage.acceptCookies();
  await summaryPage.verifyElements();
});

test('test portfolio page', async ({ context }) => {
  const { summaryPage, portfolioPage } = context;
  await summaryPage.navigate();
  await summaryPage.acceptCookies();

  await portfolioPage.navigate();
  await portfolioPage.verifyElements();
  // Additional test logic
});
```

### Benefits and Best Practices

* **Consistency**: A central interface/type ensures uniform structure across tests.
* **Scalability**: Easily expand by updating the interface/type and fixture setup.
* **Error Reduction**: TypeScript provides alerts for missing or incorrect properties.

### Conclusion

Using TypeScript interfaces and types to manage Playwright page objects is a robust method to improve the structure and integrity of test code. This approach leverages TypeScript's type system for consistency, code quality, and enhanced developer experience. Refer back to this guide to recall the setup and benefits of this methodology.
