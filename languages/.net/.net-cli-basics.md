# .NET CLI Basics

his command is from the **.NET CLI** (Command Line Interface), and it’s used to create a new project. Let’s break it down:

```
dotnet new webapi -n ExampleApi
```

#### Explanation of each part:

1. **`dotnet`**\
   This is the .NET Core command-line tool. You use it to create, build, run, and manage .NET applications.
2. **`new`**\
   Tells the CLI that you want to create a new project or solution.
3. **`webapi`**\
   This is the **template** you’re choosing.
   * `webapi` creates a **Web API project** based on ASP.NET Core.
   * The project will already include controllers, routing, JSON handling, and Swagger (for API documentation).
4. **`-n ExampleApi`**\
   The `-n` flag (short for `--name`) gives your project a name.
   * In this case, the project will be called **ExampleApi**.
   * A folder with that name will be created, and the `.csproj` file will also use this name.

#### **dotnet watch**

You can use the **watch mode** so the app automatically rebuilds and restarts when code changes.

Try this inside your project folder:

```bash
dotnet watch run
```
