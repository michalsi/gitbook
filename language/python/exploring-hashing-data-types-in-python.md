# Exploring Hashing Data Types in Python

{% hint style="success" %}
### TL;DR  <a href="#tl-dr" id="tl-dr"></a>

* **Hashing**: Transforms data into a fixed-size integer (hash value).
* **Hashable Types**: Immutable types like strings, numbers, and tuples are hashable.
* **Usage**: Essential for dictionaries, sets, and data integrity.
* **Hashing Algorithms**: Ensure data is uniformly distributed and secure.

### Hashing in Python: The Basics <a href="#hashing-in-python-the-basics" id="hashing-in-python-the-basics"></a>

In Python, hashing is the process of converting data into a fixed-size integer, known as a hash value. This integer is used to quickly compare keys in dictionaries or check membership in sets. The hash value is generated using Python's built-in `hash()` function, which works seamlessly with hashable data types.

#### Hashable Data Types 🔑 <a href="#hashable-data-types" id="hashable-data-types"></a>

To be hashable, a data type must be immutable. This ensures that its hash value remains consistent throughout its lifetime. Here are some common hashable data types in Python:

* **Strings**: Immutable sequences of characters.
* **Numbers**: Integers and floats.
* **Tuples**: Immutable sequences (provided all elements are hashable).

#### Non-Hashable Data Types 🚫 <a href="#non-hashable-data-types" id="non-hashable-data-types"></a>

Mutable types like **lists**, **dictionaries**, and **sets** **cannot be hashed** because their contents can change, leading to inconsistent hash values. If you need a hashable collection of elements, consider using `frozenset` instead of a regular set.

### The Power of Hashing Algorithms 💪🔐 <a href="#the-power-of-hashing-algorithms" id="the-power-of-hashing-algorithms"></a>

Hashing algorithms are the backbone of the `hash()` function. They transform input data of any size into a fixed-size hash value, ensuring properties like determinism, uniform distribution, and, in cryptographic contexts, irreversibility.

#### Key Properties of Hashing Algorithms <a href="#key-properties-of-hashing-algorithms" id="key-properties-of-hashing-algorithms"></a>

1. **Deterministic**: The same input always produces the same hash value.
2. **Uniform Distribution**: Hash values are spread evenly, minimizing collisions.
3. **Irreversible (Cryptographic Hashes)**: It should be infeasible to reverse-engineer the input from the hash.

#### Popular Hashing Algorithms <a href="#popular-hashing-algorithms" id="popular-hashing-algorithms"></a>

* **MD5**: Fast but not secure for cryptographic purposes due to vulnerabilities.
* **SHA-1**: More secure than MD5 but still vulnerable to collision attacks.
* **SHA-256**: Part of the SHA-2 family, offering strong security for hashing needs.

### Practical Applications 🎯 <a href="#practical-applications" id="practical-applications"></a>

Hashing is crucial for various applications:

* **Data Structures**: Efficient lookup and storage in dictionaries and sets.
* **Data Integrity**: Verify data has not been tampered with by comparing hash values.
* **Security**: Securely hash passwords and other sensitive data.

### Conclusion 🏁 <a href="#conclusion" id="conclusion"></a>

Understanding hashing in Python empowers you to leverage data structures efficiently and secure your data. By mastering how Python's `hash()` function works and the properties of hashing algorithms, you can write more robust and secure code.&#x20;
