# Code Quality Tools: Pylint, Flake8, and MyPy

When it comes to maintaining high-quality Python code, **Pylint**, **Flake8**, and **MyPy** are three essential tools. Here's a quick reference guide to help you understand their core functionalities and differences:

**Pylint**

* **Purpose:** Comprehensive linting tool for error detection, coding standards enforcement, and code smell identification.
* **Features:**
  * Extensive error detection, including syntax errors and undefined variables.
  * Enforces PEP 8 and custom coding standards.
  * Provides refactoring suggestions.
  * Highly configurable.
* **Use Case:** Ideal for thorough analysis and enforcing project-wide coding standards.

> ### [Advised linters alongside pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/)
>
> Projects that you might want to use alongside pylint include [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) (**really** fast, with builtin auto-fix and a large number of checks taken from popular linters, but implemented in rust) or [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) (a framework to implement your own checks in python using ast directly), [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy), [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) / pylance or [pyre](https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check) (typing checks), [bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) (security oriented checks), [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) (auto-formatting), [autoflake](https://github.com/myint/autoflake) (automated removal of unused imports or variables), [pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade) (automated upgrade to newer python syntax) and [pydocstringformatter](https://github.com/DanielNoord/pydocstringformatter) (automated pep257).



**Flake8 üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è**

* **Purpose:** Lightweight tool for ensuring PEP 8 compliance and basic error detection.
* **Features:**
  * Focuses on PEP 8 style adherence.
  * Basic error detection.
  * Supports plugins for extended functionality.
* **Use Case:** Best for quick checks on code style and basic errors.

**MyPy üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**

* **Purpose:** Static type checker focused on ensuring type consistency.
* **Features:**
  * Type checking based on type hints.
  * Supports gradual typing.
  * Ensures type safety and consistency.
* **Use Case:** Essential for projects prioritizing type safety and correctness.
